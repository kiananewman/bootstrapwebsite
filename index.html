        Working with Tiny Horse not only catapulted my career in production, but it also refined my adaptability skills and nurtured me with an innovative company culture. As a production intern, I wored closely with the production team on social media and web coverage for 
        various series and films. The close-knit atmosphere in the office meant I was able to be in the room when things happened. I observed firsthand
        how important business decisions were made, and I was encourage to be curious and ask questions.

       Being an intern at Tiny Horse gave me more opportunities than I had previous internships. I collaborated with team members through
